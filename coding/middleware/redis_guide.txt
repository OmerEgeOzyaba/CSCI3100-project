For the authentication features, you need to install Redis server locally, 
and also install python redis client in your virtual environment. Redis 
client was already in requirements.txt, but if you havent updated your vir-
tual environment with the latest dependencies, simply run 

	"pip install -r requirements.txt" 

and redis client will be installed to your virtual environment too. To install 
redis server on your computer locally, you need to run the following commands:

	# On macOS (using Homebrew):
	brew install redis
	brew services start redis

	# On Ubuntu/Debian:
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install redis-server
	sudo systemctl enable redis-server
	sudo systemctl start redis-server

	# Windows:
	Download from https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases
	Run redis-server.exe

	# To check if it's running (in bash)
	redis-cli ping
	# Should return "PONG"

So every time you're going to run the middleware_app.py, you have to locally 
run 
	
	# On macOS (using Homebrew)
       	brew services start redis

        # On Ubuntu/Debian:
        sudo systemctl start redis-server

        # Windows:
        Run redis-server.exe

just like how you start the docker. And every time you're done working on/run-
ning the middleware_app.py, run:

	# On Ubuntu/Debian:
	sudo systemctl stop redis-server
	# You can also run:
	sudo systemctl disable redis-server
	# but then every time before your start redis, you have to run
	# sudo systemctl enable redis-server

	# For macOS and Windows, check which commands you need to run

And that's it!

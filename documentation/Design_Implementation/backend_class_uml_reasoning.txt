Design considerations/reasoning:
================================

Classes/enumerations and their purposes:
----------------------------------------

User:
- Represents a user in the system, identified by their unique email
- Holds user credentials (email, hashed password) and information about user creation

UserService:
- Manages operations related to users, such as creating users, license key validation during registration, and enforcing password policy for security
- Interacts with the database

Task:
- Represents a task in the system
- Has properties like title, description, due date, status, and the group ID the task is assigned to

TaskService:
- Manages tasks in the system
- Interacts with the database to create tasks, update them according to membership hierarchy, mark them as completed/deleted, retrieve them by the group they're assigned to

Group:
- Represents a group in the system
- Each group has a name, description, and creation date

GroupService:
- Manages groups in the system, creating them, updating them, and leaving/deleting them. Also features retreiving all the groups a user is in, or retreiving the specified group of a user
- Interacts with the database

Membership:
- Represents the membership of a user in a group
- Tracks the user's role, invitation status, who invited them, when they were invited and when they joined

MembershipService:
- Manages memberships in the system, including sending invitations, accepting/rejecting invitations
- Interacts with the database

AuthService:
- Manages user authentication
- Handles login, logout, token generation, validation
- Interacts with the database

SoftwareLicense:
- Represents a software license in the system
- Contains unique license key, its creation date, and its usage status

Role (enumeration):
- Defines possible roles a user can have in a group
- Each role comes with special permissions

InvitationStatus (enumeration):
- Defines possible statuses of an invitation
- Determines the membership of a user in a group

Design considerations:
----------------------

- Separation of Concerns principle is respected by dividing responsibility between primary classes and service classes. While the primary classes are responsible for implementing business logic about objects in the system, service classes are tasked with data persistence.
- Scalability and extensibility is considered by dividing TaskService and GroupService. Tasks and groups can be focused on independetly, which allows adding new features like task notifications without affecting the other services.
- MembershipService is seperated from Group and User classes for managing users' roles and statuses within different groups. It separates membership-related logic, allowing for flexible role assignment and status tracking.
- Password policy enforcement in UserService provides necessary security to prevent weak passwords.
- The use of enums for user roles and invitation statuses allow for better maintainability, as any new role or status additions can be easily handled by modifying the enums. This also prevents hardcoding in the codebase.
- Service classes are modular which means new features can be added to the system wthout large-scale changes.
- Each class encapsulates a specific set of responsibilities which make the system more maintainable.

Possible improvements:
----------------------

- For performance reasons, implementing caching strategies for frequently queried data would make the system more robust.
- Querying tasks for a group can become performance-heavy as the application grows. Efficient indexing and caching will improve scalability.

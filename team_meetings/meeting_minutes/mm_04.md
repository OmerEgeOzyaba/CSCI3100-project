## ORM Explaination

- We will use the SQLAlchemy ORM
- The ORM will map the entities we define in the Backend UML to Database Tables
- So now SQL for DB creation required
- When we add a User in the code, the ORM will put the user in the DB also

"SQLAlchemy ORM (Object Relational Mapper) is a powerful library for Python that facilitates the interaction between Python objects and databases. It allows you to map Python classes to database tables and vice versa, enabling you to use Pythonic code to perform database operations, rather than writing raw SQL queries"

### Example

```python

class Author(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'authors'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)

    # Relationship with the Book class
    books = relationship("Book", back_populates="author")

class Book(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'books'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = Column(String)
    author_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('authors.id'))

    # Relationship with the Author class
    author = relationship("Author", back_populates="books"

```

## Task division - Coding

Not assigning anyone as the sole responsible of a system component, dividing tasks so that they take 2-5 hours, assigning someone for these small tasks

## TODO and final notes

Simon - uploading tasks on Trello
Kai - merging everything everyone has written for the design and implementation document
Addison - formatting the design and implementation document
Shen - submitting the design and implementation document
Omar - doing necessary updates mentioned above, refining backend class uml explanation, [maybe] coming up with a sequence diagram

Deadlines:
March 8 - Omar
March 10 - Kai and Addison
March 11 - Shen

NOTE: No one is sure about the submission page for the design and implementation documentation, Shen should submit it under "Project spec and materials" and also email a TA about it BEFORE the deadline

If something goes wrong, emergency meeting on March 11

If not, next meeting on sometime around March 12-16
